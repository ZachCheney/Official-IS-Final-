        <h2>Places I've Lived</h2>
        <p>I was born in California and lived there for 6. I have few memories of this place other than the pictures that my parents show me. My father's job then took my family to Idaho where I spent the majority of my life. I am the person I am today because of the time I sepnt in Idaho. I then went off to Utah so I could attend BYU and that is the place where I currently reside.       </p>

        <h2>Coolest Places I've Been</h2>
        <p>I have had the pleasure to visit lots of cool places in my life. I served an LDS mission to the Dominican Republic and that was an unforgetable experience that changed me forvever. 
        I also had the chance to do a summer job with Vivint that took me across the country to Florida. It is a lot different there in the South and was interesting to experience a different culture within the States. 
        Family trips are also always fun and a particular trip I took with my famly to DisneyLand will never be forgotten.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have many hobbies but my favorite thing to do in my free time is go hit the gym or get together with some friends to go play some basketball. I love the game and it is a great way for me to stay in shape. Another one of my favorite hobbies is to sit down and play the guitar. It is more of a personal and sacred thing that I do to keep me calm and relax. I enjoy learning new songs and will occasionally share them with others. I love listening to music and will take any chance I ge to put my headphones in and listen to it. I am also a big concert junkie and have a list of artsit I have seen or that I want to see.</p>
